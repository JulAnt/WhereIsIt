# Where Is It?
Race against your dog, to gather all your items before you leave the house!

Go around your apartment to pick up items you need to bring with you. Once you have one, bring it to your bag on the table next to the door. Then, quickly go look for the next item! But your dog will sometimes take an item out of the bag while you are looking around. You will need to find it again! Once you have 6 items in your bag, you can finally leave.
